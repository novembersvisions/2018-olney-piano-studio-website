<h1>Studio Procedures</h1>

<h2>Initial Interview</h2>

<p align="left">All potential students will be required to schedule a free initial interview in the studio. The interview is a time for the teacher to meet the student and their parents, learn about their goals and musical background, and answer any questions they may have.<br><br>
To schedule an initial interview please call us at <a href="#">(301) 570-0977</a> or send an email to <a href="mailto:info@OlneyPianoStudio.com">info@OlneyPianoStudio.com</a>.
</p>

<h2>At the Studio</h2>

<p align="left">Students must arrive on time. Students need to be prepared for the lesson by bringing the required music book(s).
<br><br>
Parents are welcome to sit in the studio during the lesson. It is a requirement for parents of beginners to be present at the lesson and supervise their practice until they are independent.
<br><br>
Children should never be left without parent attention outside of the studio. The teacher will only be responsible for students at the time of their lesson.
<br><br>
The teacher reserves the right to ask any disruptive individual to leave the studio.
</p>

<h2>Personal Hygiene</h2>

<p align="left">Students will be expected to wash their hands right before the piano lesson. Nails should be kept short.</p>

<h2>Attendance and Practicing</h2>

<p align="left">Regular lesson attendance and practicing at home are necessary for consistent progress. Students are expected to practice at least five days per week. The emphasis should be on the quality of the practice and not just on the time spent. The amount of daily practice time needed for your child to accomplish their practice goals will increase as the student's skill level increases. The teacher will recommend the appropriate amount of practice for each student.
<br></br>
Students must also complete written theory homework as required.</p>

<h2>Parents' Role</h2>

<p align="left">Parents should show interest in students' progress, support them with positive attitude, and encourage them to practice and perform. Parents should supervise the initial assignment and follow-up personalized assignments.
<br><br>
Please talk to the teacher about any concerns or questions that you may have about your child's progress. She will be open to any suggestions or ideas that may help you or your child.
</p>

<h2>Cancelled Lessons</h2>

<p align="left">Your lesson is a standing commitment. You may only cancel a lesson in the case of an illness or family emergency. Make-up lessons can be scheduled at a time convenient for the teacher.
<br><br>
You may also re-schedule a lesson in the case of school trips or mandatory school events if you notify the teacher two weeks in advance.
<br><br>
There is no refund and no credit for missed lessons. However, you are welcome to swap a lesson time with another willing family. The teacher will provide a swap list with telephone numbers so you can make the arrangement.
<br><br>
Please do not bring your child if they are running a fever or showing symptoms of contagious conditions.
<br><br>
We will not give a make-up lesson for multiple cancellations. Missed make-up lessons will not be rearranged.
<br><br>
We will make every effort to make up lessons cancelled due to snow days. Lessons cancelled by the teacher will be made up or credited the following month.
</p>

<h2>Termination of Lessons</h2>

<p align="left">If you would like to withdraw from piano lessons for any reason, you must give us a notice at least one month in advance from the termination date.</p>


<h2>Discontinued Lessons</h2>

<p align="left">The teacher has the right to discontinue lessons for any student who fails to make progress or misses too many lessons.</p>
